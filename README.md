The cross-cutting infrastructure every SwiftBets service shares. Each concern is its own package so a service takes only what it uses.

| Package | What it gives a service |
|---|---|
| `SwiftBets.BuildingBlocks.Core` | `CorrelationContext`, `IFaultPoint` (deterministic crash points, refused in Production), `AddValidatedOptions<T>` (fail at startup, not at first use) |
| `SwiftBets.BuildingBlocks.Resilience` | Named Polly v8 pipelines: `idempotent-http`, `keyed-http` (retries a POST only when it carries `Idempotency-Key`), `keyed-grpc`, `sql-transient` (deadlocks plus Azure SQL transients), `kafka-produce` |
| `SwiftBets.BuildingBlocks.Messaging` | Idempotent Kafka producer with envelope headers; `KafkaConsumerHost<T>`: validate → handle in a DI scope → commit only after success; poison messages go to `<topic>.dlq` and the partition keeps flowing; transient failures and future `retry-due-at` messages pause the partition instead of sleeping a worker |
| `SwiftBets.BuildingBlocks.Persistence` | `ISqlConnectionFactory`, `SqlResources` (one embedded `.sql` per query, no stored procedures), DbUp `MigrationRunner` with a journal, transactional `IInboxStore` |
| `SwiftBets.BuildingBlocks.Outbox` | `IOutbox.EnqueueAsync` inside the caller's transaction; `OutboxRelay` claims batches under a lease (`UPDLOCK, READPAST`), keeps per-key order, backs off failures and never drops a row |
| `SwiftBets.BuildingBlocks.Observability` | Serilog compact JSON, correlation ids in and out, OpenTelemetry tracing over OTLP, prometheus-net `/metrics`, `/health/live` and `/health/ready` |
| `SwiftBets.BuildingBlocks.Web` | The single error envelope (RFC 7807 + `code` + `correlationId`) for `Result` failures, validation and unhandled exceptions; security headers; RS256 JWT bearer validation against the issuer's JWKS |
| `SwiftBets.BuildingBlocks.Testing` | Testcontainers fixtures pinned to the exact platform images |

## Tests

```bash
dotnet test tests/SwiftBets.BuildingBlocks.Tests               # unit, no Docker
dotnet test tests/SwiftBets.BuildingBlocks.IntegrationTests    # Redpanda + SQL Server via Testcontainers
```

The integration suite includes the broker compatibility check (idempotent produce, consume, manual commit on the pinned client and broker), dead-lettering with the partition still flowing, transient redelivery, outbox rollback atomicity, relay publish-and-mark, and inbox deduplication.
